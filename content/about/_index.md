### Who I am

I'm Kristianto Karim, most people call me Kris. I'm a Senior Backend Engineer based in Jakarta, Indonesia. I build backend systems, mostly the kind where things need to be fast, correct, and not confusing to the next person who has to touch it.

### What I've worked on

I started at Traveloka, where I fixed a booking search system that was falling over under load and merged the airport transport and car rental sides into one platform. At Amazon Japan, I improved the experience for standard shipping and scheduled delivery across Japan. At Sembly in Singapore, I built systems around trust and reputation: scoring trustworthiness, tracking what actions users could take based on their history, and surfacing context to help people think past their assumptions. Now at [Stockbit](https://stockbit.com), I work on trading infrastructure, order execution where microseconds of latency decide whether your order gets matched or not.

The common thread: distributed systems that need to work under pressure and not be a pain to debug.

### How I think

I think more about tradeoffs than "right answers". Most decisions come down to what you're willing to give up. I'd rather ship something simple that the team gets than something clever that only I do. I default to the simplest thing that works. Complexity needs to justify itself.

### Beyond work

I like building small tools for myself, like an OCR-based expense tracker, a portfolio tracker that pulls my investments into one place with a rebalancer calculator for DCA depending on market conditions. Currently messing around with a hardware-software project for on-demand custom golf ball printing. I follow stock and crypto markets. For some reason I'm really into farming logistics, especially mushroom and duck farming. I play Mobile Legends with my brother and cousin to unwind.
