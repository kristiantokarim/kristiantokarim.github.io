lead: "Hi, I'm Kris. I'm a backend engineer based in Jakarta who enjoys working on distributed systems. Mostly backend, sometimes a bit of frontend when it touches the API layer."
---

I write about the tradeoffs, decisions, and occasional war stories behind building reliable systems at scale. Sometimes I write about things that aren't engineering at all.

If you want to know more about me, check out the [about page](/about).
